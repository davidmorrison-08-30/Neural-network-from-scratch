# Neural-network-from-scratch
This is a repository holding my code for a simple neural network

For training and testing the model, I've used the RGB dataset from https://tinyurl.com/y2qmhfsr 

The dataset contains 3 columns used for input, each indicates the "value" of a color filled in the background of an alphabet font, and 1 column used for output. The output is either 1, indicating the font should be light, or 0, indicating the font should be dark
